# Objects counting by estimating a density map with convolutional neural networks

The PyTorch implementation of https://github.com/WeidiXie/cell_counting_v2.

More details about the method can be found in [our blog post](https://neurosys.com/article/objects-counting-by-estimating-a-density-map-with-convolutional-neural-networks/).

## Data preparation

Three datasets are considered:

* `cell`: [Fluorescent cells dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/counting/index_org.html)
* `mall`: [Mall dataset](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/downloads_mall_dataset.html)
* `ucsd`: [UCSD pedestrians dataset](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/peoplecnt/)

One can get them using `get_data.py` script:

```
Usage: get_data.py [OPTIONS]

  Get chosen dataset and generate HDF5 files with training and validation samples.

Options:
  --dataset [cell|mall|ucsd]  [required]
  --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

The script download original data and preprocess it to create HDF5 files with images and labels (corresponding density maps).

## Training

Two network architectures are available so far:

* U-Net

* U-Net-MC
    The same as above but afer each layer DropOut Layer with probability p is given, except last layer.

* FCRN-A

    Weidi, Xie, J. Alison Noble, and Andrew Zisserman. "Microscopy cell counting with fully convolutional regression networks." In 1st Deep Learning Workshop, Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI). 2015.

* FCRN-A-MC
    The same as above but afer each layer DropOut Layer with probability p is given, except last layer.

One can use `train.py` script to train chosen network on selected dataset:

```
Usage: train.py [OPTIONS]

  Train chosen model on selected dataset.

                                  training dataset.
  -vf, --vertical_flip FLOAT      The probability of horizontal flip for
                                  validation dataset.
  --unet_filters INTEGER          Number of filters for U-Net convolutional
                                  layers.
